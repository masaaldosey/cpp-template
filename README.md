A repo to quickly understand the basics of a build system in a `C++` project.
Can also be used to quickly start a `C++` project.

## Things To Do

- [ ] Implement the basic directory structure.
- [ ] Add static analysis checks.
- [ ] Provide corresponding `CMakeLists.txt` for the build (with description).
- [ ] Implement corresponding _Unit Tests_.
- [ ] Enable CI pipeline using _GitHub Actions_ or any other CI tool.
- [ ] Enable documentation for the project.
